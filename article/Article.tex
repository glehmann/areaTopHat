\begin{abstract}
\noindent
The tophat transform is a well know and widely used transform based of morphological opening or closing.
It is often used to remove the background in an image, where the background is defined as the zones which do not fit in the user provided kernel.

Similarly, the tophat by area is used to remove the background in an image, but the criteria of selection is the size of the connected component, either in physical size or in number of pixels, and is independant of the shape of the connected component. This property makes easier to describe the criteria. 
% Another important property of the tophat by area, inherited from the area opening used internally, is that it ensure to never add any edge in the image -- it only removes some of them.
